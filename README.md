Spotimy (pronounced Spoti-mai) is a side project of mine that tries to help managing large Spotify song libraries. It mostly fits my usage, but maybe it will be useful to someone ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Features
- Very suspicously familiar interface
- Move to top/bottom options for songs
- Add and delete to playlist options
- Mostly functional playback toolbar
- Can control playback on a device (so no, no streaming)

## Less desired features
- Might be unstable in some situations
- Populating large playlists might take a few seconds
- No multithreading (but in some cases it was actually making things worse)
- Probably not the best Qt learning resource

## Installation
Download the source code and extract the contents of the archive.
While in a terminal in the main folder, install the requirements using (best to setup a venv beforehand):
> python -m pip install -r requirements.cfg

Then launch the main program window using python ./MainWindow.py. Voilà!
